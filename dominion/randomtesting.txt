The function executing this three cards are all achieve 100% branch coverage. I wrote random test generator for countil_room and which being the card I wrote unit test for in assignment2. The random test’s branch coverage for council_room is 100%. Function 'cardEffect_council_room'Lines executed:100.00% of 10Branches executed:100.00% of 4Compare to the unit test of council_room, the random test covered more code than the unit test. I randomly generated the value of total players, current player, and the handcount for each player, etc. Also, I running the test for hundred times. According to the random test, I found some failure. Therefore, Random test is more efficient than unit test.
