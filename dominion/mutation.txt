\f0\fs24 \cf0 Mutation test:\
I choose mutation test for part 3 to finish my testing. \
The mutation test targets are my random card_effect testers. I use mutation testing to randomtest_adventurers, randomtestcard_minion and randomtestcard_council_room. I generated 5 mutations of dominion.c based on the target. First, I test the randomtestadventurer.c using mutation testing. My random test generator killed three dominion mutations which is about drawing treasure card, shuffling deck. There are only two survived, which means my test generator is not so good. For this test generator, I did not simulate all possible situations. Also, I did not check all of the attributes in my test generator. Next, I tested my random test for council_room. This time it kills 4 dominion mutations. My dominion.c mutations changes parameters in both the draw card phase and the discard phase to crash the random test generator. Actually, my test generators checks all attributes. }
