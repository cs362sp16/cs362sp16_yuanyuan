DebuggingYuan Yuan	For debugging my code, I used random test and unit test. 	I found that when I type buy and did not successfully bug a card, I can’t buy again. It shows me that I can not buy a card any more in this tern. I reason I did not successfully buy a card is that I typed a wrong number. 	Therefore, to fix this bug, I add the following code to line 281.	  if(supplyPos == -1){   		 return -1;  		}		 Also, I used my test generator and found the bug which existed on cardEffect_council_room(), 	  //Each other player draws a card  	for (i = 0; i < state->numPlayers; i++)  	{      		drawCard(i, state);  	}	these code above should be:	for (i = 0; i < state->numPlayers; i++)  	{      		if ( i != currentPlayer )    		{     			 drawCard(i, state);    		}  	}Agents’ principles applied to the process: Understand the system: We need to first understand the system and what does this code for very clearly in order to find bugs.	Make It fail: We need to make it fail so that we can think of how to fix it. Just like what we learned in writing unit test, we have to first make the unit test fail, then, we are going to write back code to fix it. Start at small things: Sometimes a vert tiny mistake will cause a huge mistake, therefore, we can not ignore the importance of these small bugs.
