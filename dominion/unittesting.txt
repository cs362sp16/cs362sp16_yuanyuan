Coverage:The code coverage for the first test is 16.41%. This is to test the function initialization.  Therefore, it makes sense because the initialization function called a few more functions inside. The code coverage for the second test is 21.17%.The code coverage for the third test is 21.78%.The code coverage for the fourth test is 22.85%.The code coverage for the first card test is 26.07%.The code coverage for the second test is 26.99%.The code coverage for the third test is 27.91%.The code coverage for the fourth test is 28.37%.The total code coverage is 28.37% which is not so high. But the code functionality is covered. Test efforts:Overall, the test did not cover most of the code. I tested four functions and four implemented card. Therefore, the test code coverage is a little bit lower. Some code for the functions and cards I tested did not be covered. These code might be only operated under particular situations. According to the test, I discovered a few bugs which was hard to be found.
