Yuan YuanAssignment 2Unittestbugs The unittest1 is to test the initializeGame function. According to this to the failed assertion, assert(p->handCount[1]==5), I found that only the the first player get five card drew, but others did not. The second bug is occurred when excuted the cardtest2 which test the card smithy. According to the rule of smithy, after drawn three card, the played card should be discarded. Therefore, the number of the player's hand card should be 7 if it starts at 5 card. But the test failed, the result of the card is only 6. The third bug I find is occurred in the implementation of card minion. After played the card minion, other player should discard hand and redraw 4 card. But this assertion:  assert(p->handCount[1]==4)  failed. The result of p->handCount[1] equals to 5.
